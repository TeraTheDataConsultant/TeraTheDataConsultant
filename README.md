# Welcome! 

I’m Tera Earlywine, the creator of @TeraTheDataConsultant and welcome to my professional GitHub page. Here, you’ll find various frameworks, SQL code, and other solutions I’ve developed to help clients in the software technology industry.

This repository also includes open-source packages I’ve created for AI Agent development. These packages can assist with various programming tasks and serve as a meta-portfolio piece. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions.

My personal account, @teraearlywine, contains many more passion projects. Enjoy!
